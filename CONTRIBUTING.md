# Contributing to Grunt-ManifoldJS

## Want to contribute?

You can contribute in a number of ways:

1. **Report a Bug**:  We know we have them, you know we have them. Go to GitHub and help us [identify them](https://github.com/nbellocam/grunt-manifoldjs/issues).
2. **Fix a Bug or add a feature**:  We happily accept code contributions that make our framework better. We have a few code contribution requirements that need to be met (see contribution guidelines below).

##Contribution Guidelines

1. Code contribution must have an issue tracking it in the issue tracker that has been approved (Status = Active) by the main dev team. Your pull request should include a link to the bug that you are fixing.
2. You will need to grant us permission to use the submitted change according to the terms of the projectâ€™s license, and that the work being submitted is under appropriate copyright.
3. Contribution should be done through a pull request:

	1. Requests need not be a single commit, but should be a linear sequence of commits (i.e. no merge commits in your PR)
	2. Have clear commit messages ("bug fix" and "new feature" are reserved for the core team :P )

4. Should include a simple test case for you change (that passes :) ). Test cases should utilize existing test frameworks
